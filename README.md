# Currency-Exchanger
<b></b>
I'm excited to announce my new project: Currency Exchanger with API Calling. This project delves into the world of currency conversion, leveraging the power of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to retrieve real-time exchange rates. By utilizing an API, the Currency Exchanger can access up-to-date data from reliable sources, ensuring accurate conversions for various currencies. This eliminates the need for manual rate lookups and guarantees the user receives the most recent exchange values.
